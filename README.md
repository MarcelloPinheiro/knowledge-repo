# **Knowledge-Repo**  

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimentation with different datasets, focusing on data exploration, modeling, and classification. Currently, it includes two datasets sourced from **Kaggle**:  

## Datasets Used  

### Apple Quality Classification  
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Apple Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/apple-quality)  
- **Description:** This dataset contains images and features related to apple quality, making it ideal for classification tasks. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between different quality levels based on the provided attributes.  

### Environmental Impact of Food Production  
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Environmental Impact Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfvivek/environment-impact-of-food-production)  
- **Description:** This dataset provides various environmental metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water consumption, for different food products. The aim is to analyze the relationships between these variables and build predictive models for deeper insights.  

## Repository Goals  

**Classification:** Developing models to categorize apples based on quality.  
**Exploratory Analysis & Modeling:** Investigating the relationships between the environmental dataset's variables and creating robust predictive models.
